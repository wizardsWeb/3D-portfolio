to get any prebbuild 3D model you can go to the site

    https://sketchfab.com/feed

than to convert any 3D model to jsx component

    https://gltf.pmnd.rs/

when we convert the downloaded glb file to the jsx compoenent using the above site
we can use it in our code

    create a seperate component and paste the code

    make changes in the pasted code from the function to a proper component

import some packages that will be need to the run the model

    import { useFrame, useThree } from '@react-three/fiber';
    import { useGLTF } from '@react-three/drei';

to apply animations on the 3D models

    import { a } from '@react-spring/three'

to render the component we have to make changes in the vite.config

    import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
    import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

    // https://vitejs.dev/config/
    export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [react()],
    assetsInclude: ['**/*.glb']
    })

could not load the island

    import islandScene from '../assets/3d/island.glb'
    
    const { nodes, materials } = useGLTF(islandScene);


To include sky as a model
create a seperate component for it 
since it is static and primitive like no drag or nothing

    import skyScene from '../assets/3d/sky.glb'

    const sky = useGLTF(skyScene)

    <mesh>
      <primitive object={sky.scene} />
    </mesh> 

inside the canvas all the components should be covered in the mesh / <group> which includes multiple mesh

basics of adding the bird and the plane 3D model without animations and later will animate

    import { useGLTF } from '@react-three/drei'
    import birdScene from '../assets/3d/bird.glb'

    const { scene, animations } = useGLTF(birdScene)

    <mesh position={[-5, 2, 1]} scale={[0.003, 0.003, 0.003]}>
        <primitive object={ scene  } />
    </mesh>

based on the logic we added the animations for the plane bird sky and island


next we are heading towards the contact us page with the 3d Model of the fox

initially we picked the fox model from the sketchfab 
then we visited the site and coverted it to JSX code

we have to import the scene form the GLB then pass that scene as the parameter in useGLTF
